# Implementing-the-Etherhiding-technique

## Background
Google recently published reports about a new technique called Etherhiding, describing how threat actors [UNC5142](https://onhexgroup.ir/unc5142-etherhiding-blockchain/) and [UNC5342](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/dprk-adopts-etherhiding) leverage blockchain features to distribute malware.

## Overview

This repository contains a minimal, educational demo of the Etherhiding technique. The demo implements: A Solidity smart contract that returns the string: "Onhexgroup: Hi from BlockChain"
A simple HTML page that, when the user clicks a button, fetches that string from the blockchain and displays it in the browser.

The goal is to demonstrate, in a controlled test environment, how data can be stored and retrieved from a public blockchain and how that mechanism can be (ab)used in distribution scenarios.
You can follow the step-by-step implementation and additional notes in the accompanying blog post ([English](https://medium.com/@onhexgroup/implementing-the-etherhiding-technique-438979758593) / [Persian](https://onhexgroup.ir/implementing-etherhiding-technique/)).

Iâ€™ve also uploaded a video on YouTube where you can watch the full implementation process step by step.
